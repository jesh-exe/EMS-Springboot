# Employee Management System
This application was developed using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA and MySQL while I was learning the Advanced Java Module at CDAC - ACTS. This project was just to implement the concepts I learned during Advance Java Journey.
It is not a complete project, due to the time constraint I've got less time to work on this project. Will be continuing later!
